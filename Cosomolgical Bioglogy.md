If we were to conceptualize a field named "cosmological biology," it would likely be an interdisciplinary study that blends aspects of cosmology and biology. This hypothetical field might explore several intriguing areas:

Astrobiology: The most direct overlap would be astrobiology, which is already an established field. Astrobiology deals with the study of life in the universe, including the origins of life on Earth, the conditions necessary for life, and the search for extraterrestrial life.

The Origin of Life in a Cosmic Context: This area would focus on understanding how life began on Earth and whether similar processes could occur elsewhere in the universe. It would involve studying the chemical and physical conditions of early Earth and extrapolating these conditions to other celestial bodies.

Evolution of Life in Varied Cosmic Environments: It might involve studying how different cosmic conditions (like gravity, radiation, atmospheric composition) could affect the evolution of life. This could include speculative biology about life forms adapted to environments vastly different from Earth.

Panspermia Hypothesis: The study could include the panspermia hypothesis, which suggests that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, and potentially by spacecraft in the form of unintended contamination by microorganisms.

Effect of Cosmic Events on Life: Understanding how large cosmic events, such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, or major solar flares, could impact life on a planet. This includes both the history of such events on Earth and their potential effects on other planets.

Exobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI): Part of cosmological biology would likely involve the search for and study of life forms on other planets (exobiology) and the search for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe (SETI).

The Future of Life in the Universe: This could involve speculating and studying the potential future of life on Earth and elsewhere as the universe continues to evolve, considering factors like the death of stars, the expansion of the universe, and the possibility of life in other galaxies.

Cosmological biology, as a hypothetical field, would be at the exciting intersection of understanding life and the broader universe, pushing the boundaries of what we know about both biology and cosmology.
