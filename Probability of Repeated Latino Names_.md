# **Estimating the Probability of Latinos Sharing the Same Name in New Jersey**

This report aims to estimate the probability of finding Latinos with the same name multiple times in New Jersey. To achieve this, we will analyze available data on the Latino population in New Jersey, common Latino surnames and first names, and the population distribution across different counties. We will also review relevant studies on name repetition within specific communities or ethnic groups.

## **Latino Population in New Jersey**

New Jersey has a significant and growing Latino population. In 2023, an estimated 2.11 million people in New Jersey were of Hispanic or Latino origin1. This represents approximately 22.7% of the state's total population2. The Latino population is not evenly distributed across the state; for example, Latinos form one-third of the population in Newark, the state's most populous city3. Counties with the highest concentration of Latinos include Passaic (42.7%), Hudson (40.4%), and Cumberland (34.4%)4. Cities with large Latino populations include Newark, Elizabeth, and Paterson3. The growth of the Latino population in New Jersey has been significant, with an increase of nearly 4 percentage points from 2010 to 20204. The percentage of Latinos in Newark grew considerably between 1980 and 2010, from 18.6% to 33.8%3. Interestingly, despite the presence of black-Latino coalitions, voting in Newark tends to remain racially polarized3.

The diversity index in New Jersey is 61.1%5. This index measures the probability that two people chosen at random will be from different racial and ethnic groups, indicating a high level of diversity in the state.

In terms of ancestry, the Latino population in New Jersey is composed of various groups:

| Ancestry by Origin | Number |
| :---- | :---- |
| Mexican | 217,715 |
| Puerto Rican | 434,092 |
| Cuban | 83,362 |
| Dominican | 328,092 |

## **Common Latino Surnames and First Names**

Understanding the distribution of surnames and first names is crucial for estimating the probability of name repetition. While comprehensive data specific to New Jersey Latinos is limited, we can analyze common names and their origins to gain insights.

### **Surnames**

Many common Hispanic surnames are patronymic, meaning they are derived from the first name of a person's father6. For example, the suffix "-ez" often denotes "son of," as seen in names like Rodríguez (son of Rodrigo) and Martínez (son of Martin)7. Some of the most prevalent surnames include:

* **Hernández:** Meaning "son of Hernando" or "son of Fernando"8.  
* **García:** Derived from the Old Basque word "gatzea", meaning youthful or young7. It is believed to have potential Arabic or Germanic influences7.  
* **Martínez:** Meaning "son of Martin"8. The name Martin originates from Latin and is associated with the Roman god of war and fertility9.  
* **González:** Meaning "battle" or "war"7.  
* **López:** Meaning "son of Lope"8. The word "lope" comes from the Latin word "lupus," which means wolf8.  
* **Rodríguez:** Meaning "son of Rodrigo"7. The name Rodrigo means "glorious" or "power." 7  
* **Pérez:** Meaning "son of Peter"7. Peter, in turn, means "stone" or "rock." 7  
* **Sánchez:** Meaning "son of Sancho." 7  
* **Ramírez:** Meaning "famous counsel" or "wise protector"7.  
* **Flores:** Meaning "flowers"7.

It is important to note that while these surnames are common in various Latin American countries, their specific ranking and prevalence vary across these countries10. For instance, Hernández is the most common surname in Mexico, while Sánchez is the most common in Puerto Rico.

In addition to Spanish origins, many Hispanic surnames have African and Arabic roots, reflecting the diverse historical influences on Latino culture6. Surnames like Moreno and Crespo have African origins, while names starting with "Al-" like Alcalá and Alcázar have Arabic influences.

Furthermore, some surnames have origins in indigenous languages of Mexico. For example, common Maya surnames like Canek (meaning "sky star") and Balam (meaning "jaguar") are still used today8. These names were often based on animals, nature, or constellations.

While the most common surnames provide valuable insights, it's also important to consider the less frequent ones. In Mexico, for example, the rarest surnames include Moguel, Collazo, and Cabral8. This highlights the diversity of surnames within the Latino population.

### **First Names**

Common Latino first names also exhibit diversity and cultural influences. Popular first names for boys include:

* José 11  
* Santiago 11  
* Juan 11  
* Luis 11  
* Carlos 11  
* Diego 11  
* Daniel 12  
* Mateo 12  
* David 12  
* Gabriel 12

Common first names for girls include:

* Maya 11  
* Ximena 11  
* Isabella 13  
* Mia 13  
* Luna 13  
* Sofía 13  
* Camila 13  
* Emilia 13  
* Elena 13  
* Valentina 13

These names are popular in various Latin American countries and have seen increasing usage in the United States12.

Expanding the scope, a more comprehensive list of classic Spanish names includes those with religious origins, such as Félix, Arturo, Simón, and Teodoro14. This broader perspective provides a more complete picture of potential name repetition.

## **New Jersey Counties**

New Jersey is comprised of 21 counties, each with its own unique population size, demographics, and percentage of Latino residents. This information is crucial for understanding the context of name repetition within each county.

| County | County Seat | Population | Latino Percentage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Atlantic | Mays Landing | 275,213 |  |
| Bergen | Hackensack | 957,736 | 21.4% |
| Burlington | Mount Holly | 469,167 |  |
| Camden | Camden | 527,196 |  |
| Cape May | Cape May Court House | 94,610 |  |
| Cumberland | Bridgeton | 152,326 | 34.4% |
| Essex | Newark | 851,117 | 24.4% |
| Gloucester | Woodbury | 308,423 |  |
| Hudson | Jersey City | 705,472 | 40.4% |
| Hunterdon | Flemington | 130,183 |  |
| Mercer | Trenton | 381,671 | 21.7% |
| Middlesex | New Brunswick | 863,623 | 22.4% |
| Monmouth | Freehold Borough | 642,799 |  |
| Morris | Morristown | 514,423 |  |
| Ocean | Toms River | 659,197 |  |
| Passaic | Paterson | 513,395 | 42.7% |
| Salem | Salem | 65,338 |  |
| Somerset | Somerville | 348,842 |  |
| Sussex | Newton | 146,132 |  |
| Union | Elizabeth | 572,726 | 34% |
| Warren | Belvidere | 108,537 |  |

As shown in the table, counties with the highest concentration of Latinos include Passaic, Hudson, Cumberland, and Union. This suggests a higher probability of name repetition within these counties compared to those with lower Latino populations.

## **Attempts to Find Percentage of People with Common Latino First Names**

To further assess the likelihood of name repetition, we attempted to find the percentage of people with common Latino first names in New Jersey. We sought to access data from the Social Security Administration website, but unfortunately, the website was inaccessible16. \-16 This limitation highlights the challenges in obtaining precise data for this analysis.

## **Studies on Name Repetition**

Research on name repetition in specific communities or ethnic groups suggests that certain factors can increase the likelihood of individuals sharing the same name. These factors include:

* **Cultural naming practices:** Some cultures may have traditions or preferences for specific names, leading to higher repetition rates17.  
* **Immigration patterns:** Immigrant communities may have a higher prevalence of certain names due to cultural background or popular names in their countries of origin18.  
* **Socioeconomic factors:** Studies have shown a correlation between name choices and socioeconomic status within racial groups17. For example, research indicates that names most commonly given by Black mothers with a college education were less likely to be associated as "Black-sounding" compared to names given by Black mothers with a high school degree or less.

It is important to note that researchers using names to signify race in studies have significant power to potentially skew results via name selection17. This raises important questions about the methodology of such studies and their implications for understanding name repetition.

## **Estimating the Probability**

Estimating the precise probability of Latinos sharing the same name in New Jersey requires complex calculations and access to detailed datasets, including:

* **Frequency of Latino surnames and first names in New Jersey:** While we have lists of common names, we lack specific data on their distribution within the New Jersey Latino population.  
* **Population data for each county, broken down by Latino ethnicity and age:** We need more specific information on the Latino population within each county and their age distribution to accurately estimate name repetition.  
* **Studies or data on name repetition within the New Jersey Latino community:** The available data did not include any specific studies on this topic.

However, based on the available information, we can make some general observations:

* The high concentration of Latinos in certain counties and cities suggests a higher probability of name repetition in those areas.  
* The prevalence of common surnames and first names among Latinos may further increase the likelihood of individuals sharing the same name.  
* Studies on name repetition in other communities indicate that cultural factors and immigration patterns can influence name frequencies and contribute to higher repetition rates.

## **Conclusion**

While precise calculation is not possible with the current data, it is reasonable to expect a non-negligible probability of finding Latinos with the same name multiple times in New Jersey, particularly in areas with high Latino populations and among individuals with common surnames and first names. This probability is influenced by various factors, including cultural naming practices, immigration patterns, and socioeconomic factors.

The limitations of this analysis include the lack of specific data on the frequency of Latino names in New Jersey and the absence of targeted studies on name repetition within this community. Further research and access to more detailed datasets are needed to provide a more accurate estimation.

The implications of name repetition extend beyond mere statistics. Sharing a name can have profound effects on identity, community, and social interaction. It can foster a sense of belonging and shared heritage, but it can also lead to confusion and challenges in establishing individual identity. Further research could explore these social and cultural dimensions of name repetition within the Latino community in New Jersey.
