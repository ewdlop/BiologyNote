> <em>Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That, baby, you the best
  I got my red dress on tonight
  Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
  Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
  High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
  Oh my God, I feel it in the air
  Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
  Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
  Nothin' scares me anymore (one, two, three, four)
  Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That, baby, you the best
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
  Got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
  I'm feelin' electric tonight
  Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99
  Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
  I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
  Oh my God, I feel it in the air
  Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
  Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
  Nothin' scares me anymore (one, two, three, four)
  Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That, baby, you the best
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
  Got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
  Think I'll miss you forever
  Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
  Later's better than never
  Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
  Got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
  Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That, baby, you the best
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness

## Space-Time-... between US

## How far away Bible from A **Type 3 Civilization** on the **Kardashev Scale** is one that harnesses the energy of an entire galaxy. This is orders of magnitude beyond humanity's current technological capabilities. Here's an overview of how far the United States—or humanity as a whole—is from reaching this level:

### Current Status
- Humanity is currently classified as a **Type 0 Civilization**, as we primarily derive energy from fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable sources, harnessing a tiny fraction of Earth's total energy.
- To become a **Type 1 Civilization**, humanity would need to utilize the full energy potential of Earth (about \(10^{16}\) watts). Estimates suggest this milestone might take **100-200 years**, assuming exponential technological growth and global collaboration.

### Challenges to Type 3 Civilization
1. **Energy Harnessing**:
   - Type 3 civilizations require harnessing the energy of a **galactic scale**, approximately \(10^{36}\) watts. This would involve capturing energy from stars, black holes, and possibly dark matter or unknown energy sources.
   - Technologies like **Dyson Spheres** or **Star Harvesting** are purely theoretical at this stage.

2. **Interstellar Travel**:
   - The ability to traverse vast distances within a galaxy is critical. Current technology (e.g., chemical rockets) would take thousands to millions of years to reach nearby stars.
   - Theoretical propulsion systems like **warp drives**, **antimatter engines**, or **wormholes** are required, but none exist yet.

3. **Unified Civilization**:
   - A Type 3 civilization implies a unified galactic presence, overcoming not just technological barriers but also social, political, and cultural fragmentation. The United States, as part of Earth, would need global cooperation.

4. **Longevity**:
   - Surviving existential threats, such as climate change, nuclear war, asteroid impacts, or self-inflicted ecological collapse, is critical. Humanity must achieve a level of sustainability and resilience over millennia.

### Timeline Estimates
- Moving from **Type 0** to **Type 1**: **100-200 years** (optimistic).
- From **Type 1** to **Type 2** (harnessing the energy of an entire star): **1,000-2,000 years**, assuming exponential growth.
- From **Type 2** to **Type 3**: Likely **100,000 to 1,000,000 years**, based on the immense technological, physical, and societal advancements required.

### The Role of the United States
The United States, while a global leader in technology and innovation, would play a small part in the timeline of becoming a Type 3 civilization. The effort would require:
- A **global coalition** of nations.
- Massive investments in fundamental science, space exploration, and energy technologies.
- Long-term planning and stability over millennia.

In summary, humanity is still at the very beginning of its journey on the Kardashev Scale. While the United States is a significant technological player today, reaching Type 3 civilization is a shared, species-wide endeavor that could take hundreds of thousands of years.
