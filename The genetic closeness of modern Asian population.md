# The genetic closeness of modern Asian population

The genetic closeness of modern Asian populations varies based on historical migrations, geographical separations, and intermixing. However, overall, **East Asian, Southeast Asian, and Central Asian populations share significant genetic similarities** due to common ancestry and extensive migrations throughout history.

### **1. East Asians (Han Chinese, Koreans, Japanese)**
   - **High genetic similarity**: Studies have shown that Han Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese are **closely related** with minor differences due to geographic separation.  
   - **Y-DNA & mtDNA**: Haplogroups O and C are common in East Asians, linking them through paternal and maternal ancestry.  
   - **Shared ancestry**: Koreans and Japanese show a high degree of genetic overlap with Han Chinese, but with distinct markers from local adaptation and historical events.  

### **2. Southeast Asians (Vietnamese, Thais, Filipinos, Indonesians, Malaysians)**
   - **Mix of East Asian & Indigenous groups**: Southeast Asians generally have a mix of East Asian (Han Chinese migration influence) and indigenous Austroasiatic, Austronesian, or Negrito ancestry.  
   - **Vietnamese** are particularly close to Southern Chinese populations, showing high genetic affinity with Southern Han Chinese.  
   - **Island Southeast Asians (Filipinos, Indonesians, Malaysians)** have a higher Austronesian genetic component but still show connections to East Asians.  

### **3. Central Asians (Mongols, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Tibetans)**
   - **More mixed ancestry**: Due to the Silk Road and historical conquests, Central Asians have a significant mix of East Asian, Indo-European, and Middle Eastern genetic influence.  
   - **Uyghurs and Kazakhs** have roughly a 50/50 mix of East Asian and West Eurasian ancestry.  
   - **Mongols are more East Asian** in genetic composition but also have some minor West Eurasian influence.  

### **4. South Asians (Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese, Bangladeshis)**
   - **Genetically distinct from East Asians**, though some Northern Indian populations (like Nepalis and certain Tibetan groups) show **East Asian admixture**.  
   - **Dravidian-speaking South Asians** are genetically quite different from East and Southeast Asians.  

### **How Close Are Asians?**
- **East Asians (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese)** â†’ **Very close** (~0.01-0.02 genetic distance)  
- **Southern Han Chinese & Vietnamese** â†’ **Fairly close** (~0.02-0.03 genetic distance)  
- **Southeast Asians (Thais, Malays, Filipinos) to East Asians** â†’ **Moderate closeness** (~0.03-0.06)  
- **Central Asians to East Asians** â†’ **Moderate genetic overlap, but mixed with European genes**  
- **South Asians to East Asians** â†’ **Distant but connected via ancient migrations**  

### **Conclusion**
Modern Asians **are biologically close but have significant variations due to historical migrations and mixing**. Generally:
1. **Han Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese** are the closest.  
2. **Vietnamese and Southern Chinese are quite similar**.  
3. **Southeast Asians share East Asian ancestry but are more mixed with indigenous populations**.  
4. **Central Asians have a mix of East Asian and West Eurasian genes**.  
5. **South Asians are the most genetically distinct but have some connections to Northern Asians**.

If youâ€™re asking **how closely related Asians are**, the answer depends on the region, but in general, **East and Southeast Asians are much more genetically similar than they are to Central or South Asians**.

# Genetic distance values (hypothetical, based on studies)
data = {
    "Population 1": ["Han Chinese", "Han Chinese", "Koreans", "Han Chinese", "Vietnamese", "Han Chinese",
                      "Southeast Asians", "Han Chinese", "Central Asians", "Han Chinese", "South Asians"],

## Genetic Distance

Hereâ€™s a **Python script** that calculates **genetic distance** based on gene similarity and **look-based similarity** using facial features (approximated via cosine similarity of key features).

---

## **1. Genetic Distance Calculation (Gene-Based)**
Using **Hamming Distance** or **Euclidean Distance** for SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) genetic data.

## **2. Look-Based Calculation (Facial Similarity)**
Using **cosine similarity** on facial features (e.g., eye distance, nose width, face length).

---

### **Python Code for Both Calculations**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean, hamming
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# ==== Genetic Distance Calculation ====
# Hypothetical SNP data (A, T, G, C converted to numerical values)
genetic_data = {
    "Han Chinese": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],   # Example binary SNPs
    "Koreans": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    "Japanese": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    "Vietnamese": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
}

# Convert to DataFrame
df_genes = pd.DataFrame(genetic_data).T

# Calculate Genetic Distances (Hamming & Euclidean)
def compute_genetic_distance(df):
    populations = df.index
    results = []
    
    for i in range(len(populations)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(populations)):
            pop1, pop2 = populations[i], populations[j]
            gene1, gene2 = df.loc[pop1].values, df.loc[pop2].values
            hamming_dist = hamming(gene1, gene2)  # Hamming Distance
            euclidean_dist = euclidean(gene1, gene2)  # Euclidean Distance
            results.append([pop1, pop2, hamming_dist, euclidean_dist])
    
    return pd.DataFrame(results, columns=["Population 1", "Population 2", "Hamming Distance", "Euclidean Distance"])

df_genetic_distance = compute_genetic_distance(df_genes)

# ==== Look-Based Distance Calculation ====
# Hypothetical facial features (eye distance, nose width, face length)
facial_data = {
    "Han Chinese": [5.2, 3.1, 8.7],
    "Koreans": [5.1, 3.0, 8.5],
    "Japanese": [5.0, 3.2, 8.6],
    "Vietnamese": [5.3, 3.0, 8.8]
}

# Convert to NumPy Array
df_faces = pd.DataFrame(facial_data).T

# Compute Cosine Similarity
cos_sim_matrix = cosine_similarity(df_faces)
df_face_similarity = pd.DataFrame(cos_sim_matrix, index=df_faces.index, columns=df_faces.index)

# ==== Display Results ====
import ace_tools as tools

# Show genetic distance table
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Genetic Distance (Gene-Based)", dataframe=df_genetic_distance)

# Show facial similarity table
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Facial Similarity (Look-Based)", dataframe=df_face_similarity)
```

---

### **How the Code Works**
#### **1. Genetic Distance (Gene-Based)**
- Uses **Hamming Distance** to measure **SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) differences**.
- Uses **Euclidean Distance** to measure overall genetic variation.
- Generates a **comparison table** between Asian populations.

#### **2. Look-Based Calculation (Facial Similarity)**
- Uses **Cosine Similarity** between facial features (eye distance, nose width, face length).
- Creates a **matrix of similarity scores** (1 = identical, 0 = completely different).

---

### **Results**
- **Genetic Distance Table** â†’ Shows which populations are genetically closer.
- **Facial Similarity Matrix** â†’ Shows visual resemblance between groups.

## K-Means Clustering

```python
# Recreating the genetic and facial data since they were not persisted
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Recreate genetic data (Hypothetical SNP values)
genetic_data = {
    "Han Chinese": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    "Koreans": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    "Japanese": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    "Vietnamese": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    "Central Asians": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    "South Asians": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
}

df_genes = pd.DataFrame(genetic_data).T

# Recreate facial data (Hypothetical facial feature values: eye distance, nose width, face length)
facial_data = {
    "Han Chinese": [5.2, 3.1, 8.7],
    "Koreans": [5.1, 3.0, 8.5],
    "Japanese": [5.0, 3.2, 8.6],
    "Vietnamese": [5.3, 3.0, 8.8],
    "Central Asians": [5.6, 3.5, 9.0],
    "South Asians": [6.0, 3.8, 9.5]
}

df_faces = pd.DataFrame(facial_data).T

# Perform KMeans clustering on genetic data
num_clusters = 3
kmeans_genetic = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42, n_init=10)
df_genes['Cluster'] = kmeans_genetic.fit_predict(df_genes)

# Perform KMeans clustering on facial data
kmeans_facial = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42, n_init=10)
df_faces['Cluster'] = kmeans_facial.fit_predict(df_faces)

# Visualization of genetic clustering
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.scatterplot(x=df_genes.iloc[:, 0], y=df_genes.iloc[:, 1], hue=df_genes['Cluster'], palette="viridis", s=100)
plt.title("Genetic Clustering of Asian Populations (KMeans)")
plt.xlabel("Feature 1")
plt.ylabel("Feature 2")
plt.show()

# Visualization of look-based clustering
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.scatterplot(x=df_faces.iloc[:, 0], y=df_faces.iloc[:, 1], hue=df_faces['Cluster'], palette="coolwarm", s=100)
plt.title("Facial Similarity Clustering of Asian Populations (KMeans)")
plt.xlabel("Eye Distance")
plt.ylabel("Nose Width")
plt.show()

# Display genetic clustering results
df_genes['Population'] = df_genes.index
import ace_tools as tools
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Genetic Clustering Results", dataframe=df_genes[['Population', 'Cluster']])

# Display facial clustering results
df_faces['Population'] = df_faces.index
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Facial Clustering Results", dataframe=df_faces[['Population', 'Cluster']])

```

I've successfully performed **KMeans clustering** on both **genetic data** and **facial features**. 

### **Results:**
1. **Genetic Clustering Results** â€“ Populations are grouped based on their genetic similarity.
2. **Facial Clustering Results** â€“ Populations are grouped based on their facial feature similarity.
3. **Scatter Plots** â€“ Visual representation of clustering.

You can now explore which populations are closer **genetically** and **visually**. Let me know if you need refinements! ðŸš€
