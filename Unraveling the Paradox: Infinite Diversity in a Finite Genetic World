The situation you're describing does seem paradoxical at first glance, but it actually highlights the complexity and richness of genetic mechanisms. The key to resolving this apparent paradox lies in understanding the dynamic nature of genetics and how genetic diversity is generated and maintained. Here are a few points to consider:

Vast Potential Combinations: While the human genome is finite and contains a set number of genes, the number of potential combinations of these genes is extraordinarily high. Each human has a unique combination of alleles (versions of genes), and the process of sexual reproduction, involving recombination and independent assortment, ensures a vast array of genetic combinations. This richness in combination possibilities means that even within a finite genetic space, the potential for variation is almost limitless.

Role of Mutations: Mutations add another layer of complexity. Although most of our DNA is shared and similar, mutations can introduce new genetic variations. Over generations, these mutations can accumulate, leading to significant genetic diversity. In a larger population, the absolute number of mutations occurring is higher, contributing to greater genetic diversity.

Genetic Drift and Bottlenecks: In small populations, genetic drift can lead to a significant change in allele frequencies, purely by chance. Population bottlenecks, where a significant portion of the population is wiped out, can drastically reduce genetic diversity. However, as the population grows again, the diversity also tends to increase, albeit slowly and not always to the original level.

Selective Pressures and Environment: Larger populations are often spread over a wider range of environments, leading to different selective pressures in different sub-populations. This can result in diverse adaptations and increase overall genetic diversity.

Gene Flow: In larger populations, especially those that are geographically spread out, there's more opportunity for gene flow - the movement of genes from one population to another. This movement further contributes to genetic diversity.

In summary, the paradox is resolved by understanding that the human genome's "finite" nature doesn't limit genetic diversity as much as one might think. The processes of mutation, recombination, natural selection, and gene flow all act to ensure that even within a bounded genetic space, the potential for variability is enormous. This is a fundamental principle that underlies the adaptability and evolution of species.
